Following are the terms that come to my mind when we talk about OAuth 2.0

* **OAuth**

  OAuth is a decentralized way of authorizing the consumer with generally no information about user known to the consuming application. The information that resource owner most certainly wants to protect is his/her authentication credentials.

  OAuth came into existence as OAuth 1.0 and later on revised to more popular and current version 2.0 as a standard specification defined in form of [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).
